## Mixed Molecules

A box contains \[10000\] gas molecules, \[2500\] of 
nitrogen and \[7500\] of argon in thermal equilibrium. 
The molecular weight of \[N_2\] is \[28g/mol\], and of 
\[Ar\] is \[40g/mol\]. The total kinetic energy of the 
collection of \[10000\] molecules is \[5 x 10-17 J\].

What is the temperature of this gas?

* Need to use _Equipartition Theorem_
* If the number of molecules in the system were doubled,
  the totol kinetic energy would double too.
* Replacing the current molecules with larger weight 
  The kinetic energy of the of the molecules remains constant.
* Replacing monatonic molecules with diatomic the kinectic 
  energy decreases.
* Energy with quadratic degree's of freedom
  * Translational kinectic energy
  * spring potential energy
  * rotational kinectic energy
* monatomic gas particles have 3 degrees of freedom in equipartition
* diatomic gas particles have 5 degrees of freedom
* The average energy per molecule of Argon, a monotonic molecule,
  is \[3 (( 1/2) k_B T) = (3/2) k_B T\]
* The average energy per molecule of \[N_2\], a diatomic molecule, 
  is \[5 ((1/2) k_B T) = (5/2)k_B T\].
