## Mixed Molecules

A box contains \[10000\] gas molecules, \[2500\] of 
nitrogen and \[7500\] of argon in thermal equilibrium. 
The molecular weight of \[N_2\] is \[28g/mol\], and of 
\[Ar\] is \[40g/mol\]. The total kinetic energy of the 
collection of \[10000\] molecules is \[5 x 10-17 J\].

What is the temperature of this gas?

\[KE_total = \left(\frac{ 3}{ 2}\right) |Ar| k_B T + \frac{ 5}{ 2} |N_2| k_B T\]
    * \[k_B = 1.381 \times 10^{-23}\]
* Need to use _Equipartition Theorem_
* If the number of molecules in the system were doubled,
  the totol kinetic energy would double too.
* Replacing the current molecules with larger weight 
  The kinetic energy of the of the molecules remains constant.
* Replacing monatonic molecules with diatomic the kinectic 
  energy decreases.
* Energy with quadratic degree's of freedom
  * Translational kinectic energy
  * spring potential energy
  * rotational kinectic energy
* monatomic gas particles have 3 degrees of freedom in equipartition
* diatomic gas particles have 5 degrees of freedom
* The average energy per molecule of Argon, a monotonic molecule,
  is \[3 (( 1/2) k_B T) = (3/2) k_B T\]
* The average energy per molecule of \[N_2\], a diatomic molecule, 
  is \[5 ((1/2) k_B T) = (5/2)k_B T\].

## Diatomic Equipartition
A container of gas molecules is at a pressure of 2 atm and has a mass 
density of 1.7 grams per liter. All of the molecules in the container 
are diatomic nitrogen molecules with an atomic weight of 28 grams per mole. 
What is the typical speed of the nitrogen molecules in the container? Here 
we define the typical speed to be the root-mean-square velocity 
(RMS velocity = vrms) of the center of mass of the molecule.

* Every Quadratic degree of freedom contributes the same amount
  to the internal energy of the molecules.
* 3 degress of freedom to move
* 2 degree of freedom to rotate
* We need to look at the translational kinetic energy
  * \[KE = \left( \frac{ 3}{ 2}\right) (k) (T)\]
* Each molecule has average energy \[\frac{ 1}{ 2} k T\] per degree of
  freedom.
* \[KE_{totoal} = \frac{ 5}{ 2} k T\]
* Only the transiational kinectic energy determines the RMS velocity of the
  center of mass of the molecules in the gas.
* Using \[KE = \frac{ 1}{ 2} m v^2\] we can find RMS
