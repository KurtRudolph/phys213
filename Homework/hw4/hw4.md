## Boltman Distrobution, Entropy

### 1)
\[P_n = d_n e^{mgh/kT}\]

Where \[m\] is the mass of one molecule, \[g\] is gravity, and \[h\] is the height.

\[P_N / P_0 = e^{mgh/kT}\]

## Satellite

### 2)
\[J = \sigma_{sb} T^4\] where \[\sigma_{sb}\] is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

\[P = J \times A\]
\[\sigma_{sb} T^4 A  = P\]
